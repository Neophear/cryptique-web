      Welcome to my hobby project! Here, you can encrypt your text or data and send the decryption
      info to someone else (or use it yourself). Here's the scoop: the encryption happens on the
      server, which randomly generates a key that isn't stored anywhere. Once your message is
      encrypted, the key is sent back to you and promptly forgotten by the server.<br />
      <br />
      Since this is just for fun, I can't promise your messages will stick around for the advertised
      time.<br />
      <br />
